<h1>Tibia Implant Dipping</h1>
Tibia Implant Dipping (T.I.D.) is a software tool for converting CT-scans into 3D models with material properties.
<br />
The implant dipping tool extracts material properties at the interface between the bone model and an implant of arbitary geometry. 
<br />
We will be developing the computational processing, GUI, and web back-end so that T.I.D can be accessed as a web service.
